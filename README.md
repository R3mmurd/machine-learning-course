This repository contains my solutions for programming assigments of this
course. You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are
doing the course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

## About this course

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
(parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems,
deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation
process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies
and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart
robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical
informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

This is an eleven-weeks course. We made eight graded exercises in the programming language
[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Each subdirectory contains a pdf file with
the excercise specification and another subdiretory with the solution itself.

The course was structured as follows:

- **Week 1**: Linear Regression with One Variable and Linear Algebra Review.

- **Week 2**: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables and Octave/Matlab Tutorial.

- **Week 3**: Logistic Regression and Regularization.

- **Week 4**: Neural Networks: Representation.

- **Week 5**: Neural Networks: Learning.

- **Week 6**: Advice for Applying Machine Learning and Machine Learning System Design.

- **Week 7**: Support Vector Machines.

- **Week 8**: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction.

- **Week 9**: Anomaly Detection.

- **Week 10**: Large Scale Machine Learning.

- **Week 11**: Application Example: Photo OCR.
